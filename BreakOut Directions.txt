How to Play:

The goal of this game is to break all of the bricks with the ball without letting the ball drop 
below the paddle and off the screen.

After starting the program, the user left-clicks to start the game. The ball will then proceed
upwards from the paddle on the bottom, breaking any brick that it strikes. To control the paddle,
the user uses the left arrow key to slide left and the right arrow key to slide right. Depending on
where the ball strikes the paddle, the ball could be directed to the left or right. If the ball falls 
below the paddle, the paddle and ball will reset in the center and the user must left-click to send 
the ball upwards again. If the ball falls below the paddle for a second time, it is game over.

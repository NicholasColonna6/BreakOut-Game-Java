In the file 'BreakOut Directions.txt' you will find a brief description of the game and instructions on how to play.

NOTE: In order for the game to play, you will need two libraries, ACM.jar and ObjectDrawV1.1.2.jar, which are
both included in the 'lib' folder. These will then need to be configured to the build path. 
Instructions on how to do this are below, for your reference.

Using Eclipse IDE:
1. Right-click the project/class folder and select "Properties"
2. Select "Java Build Path" on the left side, then click into the "Libraries" tab.
3. Now, click the "Add External JARS..." button
4. Locate and enter the 'lib' folder submitted with this program. Select the 'acm.jar' and the 
'objectdrawV1.1.2.jar' files, then click "Open"
5. Click "OK" / "Apply and Close" to save the changes and apply the JAR files. 
6. If everything worked, there should be an item called "Referenced Libraries" now in the project folder
that contains both the JARS installed.
